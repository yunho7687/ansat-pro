# ANSAT-Pro

The objective of this application is to establish a communication platform between the facilitators and preceptor/s.     

A facilitator is an experienced nurse employed by the university or health service to oversee a group of student’s clinical placements and is responsible for the assessment of student performance against the Registered Nurse Standards for Practice.        

A preceptor is a registered nurse employed by the health service to provide clinical care and who also works alongside the student during a shift. Students may be allocated a different preceptor each shift. 
A critical component of the facilitator’s role is to liaise with the preceptors to obtain feedback on students’ performance to inform their assessment.      

Australian Nursing standard assessment tool ([ANSAT](https://www.ansat.com.au/)), made up of 7 Registered Nurse Standards for Practice which have a total of 23 items listed beneath the standards. The 23 items are scored by the facilitator to determine student performance using a 1-5 scale (1 is poor 5 is excellent). The facilitator will have used the gathered information from the app to mark the student appropriately.      
  
### Responsibilities of Preceptors
1. Preceptors can find the student they work with and give them a short informal feedback based on their work on that day or shift.    
2. Preceptor need to double chech the studnet infomation who work with them for each shif
3. Preceptor need to give feedback to the student and decide weather to communicate with the student's facilitator further.
4. Preceptor need to check if the AI summary of the feedback align with the intenstion of the feedback.
5. Preceptor need to select need to communicate with the facilitator if necessary.


### Responsibilities of Facilitator
1. Facilitator need to register students so that other users can find this studnet in the search module (e.g. the search area).
2. Facilitator need to oversee the students they registered and need to contact the preceptor if there's a notification shows the preceptor require a communication.
3. Facilitator need to review all the feedback of each students and mark them based on those student.
4. Facilitator can get AI summary of each student from their history feedback and help facilitator give marks to students


### AI summary 
1. The AI summary for preceptors' each feedback will show how many aspects in ANSAT mathed in each feedback
2. The AI summary for facilitator will show each (23 in total) aspect in ANSAT and the extent of the consistency with each aspect (e.g. from feedback 1 and 5 shows excelent critical thinking)
